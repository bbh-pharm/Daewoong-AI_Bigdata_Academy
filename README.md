# Daewoong AI Bigdata Academy
The Academy I participated as Daewoong Scholarship student. (2021.05 ~2021.10)  

## What program is this?
  This repository is to organize materials and my projects in **Daewoong AI Bigdata Academy (a.k.a DABA)**. Daewoong is a famous company in the pharmaceutical field in Korea. They regularly holds this AI academy not only for employees but students selected. The students selected by Daewoong can be given an opportunity to receive this education together and scholarships. After intensive training for 5 weeks, it also provides experience to work with other employees for the next 4 months.
 
## Reasons for participation
 Industrial data is difficult to access, as many companies are reluctant to disclose it. Additionally, medicinal data such as prescriptions is also difficult to obtain because it's related to personal information protection. Since I majored in pharmacy, I always wanted to deal with drug-related data. While looking for a way, I found out that Daewoong Pharmaceutical was conducting this program, so I was waiting for recruitment. Eventually, I applied for DABA and was able to participate.

## Things that I learned and get here
I learned how the project is being carried out in practice, and that AI is being applied in various ways in the pharmaceutical industry. Also during this experience, I became interested in smart factories. Lastly I realized again that domain knowledge is very important to become a good data analyst and data scientist.
